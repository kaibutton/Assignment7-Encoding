ICS 311 Strings &amp; Encryption Encoding

<h1>Send compressed messages  from one person to another using run-length encoding. The metadata should indicate that the message is run-length encoded</h1>


Javascript classes and library Vis.js were used to implement a graphical node diagram that helps to visualize a network of "friends". Each friend is able to send run-length-encoded messages to one another using a run-length-encoding algorithm defined in run-length-encoding-function.js.

Run length encoding algorithms are useful in compressing messages or data that has reoccuring strings of numbers, characters, or values. Such an example would be image compresion, where it is likely that multiple pixels in the same row or column share the same RGB value and thus can be compressed relatively easliy and losslessly.
